#  Project Name
Exchange Rate Calculator

# Project Description
Javascript project for an exchange rate calculator that allows the user to 
choose from multiple countries.

# Why I Built It
Practice calling an API (https://v6.exchangerate-api.
com/v6/6f44c0f6bbd6ab7f09dbc6af/latest/USD) and utilizing the information 
returned for the 
conversion rates.

# What I Would Do Next
Add another country to show the conversion rate for more than one 
country at a time.

# What I Learned
I learned to add more detail to my comments for later reference and/or 
anyone looking at my code. How to use async and await instead of promises.

# Stack Information
* HTML
* CSS
* Vanilla Javascript
* JSON 
* Fetch

# How To Use It
Select your country and input the amount you want exchanged. Select the 
country you want the conversion for the amount you entered.
